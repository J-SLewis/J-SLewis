## Hi there 👋

<!--
**J-SLewis/J-SLewis** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on being a good student
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on how to create and merge files using c#
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with lists
